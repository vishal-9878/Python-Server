# Simple Web Server

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple web server using Python. The server is capable of handling HTTP requests, returning different types of content (such as JSON, HTML, and plain text), and performing routing based on the requested URL.

## Features

- Basic HTTP server functionality
- Returns different types of content:
  - JSON
  - HTML
  - Plain text
- Performs routing based on requested URL

## Getting Started

To run the server locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/) if you haven't already done so.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `server.py` file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
5. Run the following command to start the server:
6. Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the server.

## Usage

- Access the root URL (`/`) to see the default response.
- Access other routes (e.g., `/about`) to see different responses based on routing.
- Modify the `server.py` file to customize the server behavior according to your requirements.
